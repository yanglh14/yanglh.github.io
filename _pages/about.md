<span class='anchor' id='about-me'></span>

I work at Noah's Ark Lab as a Robotics Researcher in Hong Kong since 2024.

I graduated from the Department of Computer Science, University of Hong Kong (Hong Kong) with a PhD degree under supervision of Dr. Pan Jia (HKU) and Dr. Song Chaoyang (Sustech). 
I received my B.S. degree from the Department of Precise Instrument, Tsinghua University (Beijing) in 2018. 
I worked with Dr. Huang Bidan from Tencent RoboticsX from April 2021 to July 2022 with the Tencent Rhino-Bird Elite Talent Program.

My research focuses on **robotics perception and manipulation** using learning-based methods. Specifically, I am interested in:
Developing a generic representation for world understanding through vision and tactile sensing;
Enhancing decision-making in unstructured environments with rich interactions.
